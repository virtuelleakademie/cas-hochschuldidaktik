Evidence-Based Guidance for Coaching a Student Through Reflection

Importance of Reflection and Role of a Coach

Educational research consistently shows that deep reflection transforms experience into learning and improves professional practice. A coach can help students or teachers move beyond superficial recounting of events to critical analysis and intentional planning. A reflective coach is a supportive partner who creates a safe, non‑judgmental space, listens actively, and guides the learner through structured questions. Effective reflection improves self‑awareness, emotional regulation, decision‑making and professional growth ￼.  The coach’s role is to ask open‑ended questions that encourage learners to examine what happened, why it happened, and what they will do differently next time ￼, while avoiding judgments and prescriptive advice.

Evidence-Based Coaching Frameworks

1. See – Think – Do (Vosaic)

This model encourages objective description before analysis:
	•	Observe (See) – Describe what occurred without judgment; coaches can show a video or revisit an event and ask the learner to provide a play‑by‑play account ￼.
	•	Process (Think) – Ask questions about feelings before and during the event and whether expectations were met ￼.
	•	Analyze – Explore what worked or did not work and why ￼.
	•	Draw Conclusions & Plan (Do) – Summarize takeaways and set specific action steps for the future; coaches encourage SMART goal‑setting ￼ ￼.

2. Henley8 Reflective Practice Model (Tracy Sinclair)

This eight‑question cycle helps coaches guide deeper exploration:
	1.	What did I observe?
	2.	What was my response?
	3.	What does this tell me about me?
	4.	What does this tell me about myself as a coach or learner?
	5.	What strengths does this offer?
	6.	What are the potential pitfalls?
	7.	What did I learn?
	8.	What might I do differently next time?

Coaches ask these questions sequentially to help the learner connect experience to self‑awareness, strengths, pitfalls, lessons and future actions.

3. Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle

Gibbs’ six‑stage cycle is widely used to structure reflective conversations ￼.  Steve Barkley describes how coaches can use Gibbs’ stages when conferencing with teachers:
